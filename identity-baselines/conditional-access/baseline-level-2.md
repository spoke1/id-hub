# Conditional Access Baseline – Level 2 (Enhanced Security)

Level 2 expands on the Baseline by enforcing MFA more broadly, introducing device compliance for sensitive apps, and tightening administrative access.

It is ideal for organizations ready for stronger identity protections.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Widen MFA coverage  
- Enforce secure devices for sensitive apps  
- Strengthen administrative sessions  
- Introduce risk-sensitive controls  
- Reduce attack surface for common identity threats  

---

# 🧱 Included Policies (Level 2)

## 🔹 1. Broad MFA for All Users  
**Goal:** Protect all key workloads with MFA  
**Scope:** All users → All cloud apps  
**Exclusions:** Break-glass overrides only  

---

## 🔹 2. Require Compliant Devices for Admin Access  
**Scope:**  
- Azure Portal  
- Entra Admin Center  
- Intune Admin Center  

**Grant Controls:**  
- Require MFA  
- Require compliant device  
- Require app protection (optional)  

---

## 🔹 3. Require Compliant or Hybrid Joined Devices for Sensitive Apps  
Examples:  
- HR systems  
- ERP/Finance systems  
- Customer data stores  

---

## 🔹 4. Strengthen Session Controls  
**Sign-in frequency:** 1–7 days depending on risk  
**Persistent browser sessions:** Disable for admins  

---

## 🔹 5. High-Risk User Sign-ins → Block Access  
**Requirements:** Azure AD P2 license  
**Action:**  
- Block high-risk sign-ins  
- Require password reset for medium risk  

---

## 🔹 6. Expand Break-glass Monitoring  
Automated alerts for:  
- Sign-ins from unknown locations  
- Sign-ins without MFA  
- Sign-ins outside expected hours  

---

# 📘 Deployment Guidance

- Pilot device-based access with IT departments first  
- Introduce session controls gradually to reduce user friction  
- Expand compliant devices via Intune or MDM baselines  

Level 2 aligns well with early Zero Trust maturity models.
