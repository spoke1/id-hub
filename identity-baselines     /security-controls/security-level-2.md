# Identity Security Controls – Level 2 (Hardened)

Level 2 introduces **strong privileged access governance**, risk-based response, and improved authentication security.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reduce standing privilege  
- Respond automatically to identity risks  
- Strengthen authentication methods  
- Improve detection & response  

---

## 🧱 Included Controls

## 🔹 Identity Protection (Automated)
- Configure user and sign-in risk policies  
- High-risk users → require password reset  
- High-risk sign-ins → block or step-up  

---

## 🔹 Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- All admin roles protected by PIM  
- Just-in-Time activation  
- MFA required for activation  
- Approval required for high-privilege roles  

---

## 🔹 Authentication Method Governance
- Disable legacy MFA methods  
- Enforce number matching  
- Encourage passwordless pilots (admins first)  

---

## 🔹 Break-Glass Monitoring
- Alert on break-glass sign-ins  
- Monitor location, device & time anomalies  
- Review usage quarterly  

---

## 🔹 Logging & Alerting
- Forward Entra logs to SIEM  
- Alert on:
  - risky sign-ins  
  - admin role activation  
  - MFA failures  

---

## 📘 Notes
Level 2 significantly reduces identity attack surface and is recommended for most organizations.
