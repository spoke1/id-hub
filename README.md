🚀 Overview

Identity Secure Hub is my flagship open-source portfolio that brings together
architecture, security patterns, and automation for modern Microsoft cloud identity.

This repository serves as a complete knowledge and tooling platform for:

- Microsoft Entra ID
- Identity Governance (IG)
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Intune Automation & Modern Endpoint
- Graph API Security Automation
- Baselines, Guardrails, and Architecture Patterns

Designed for architects, engineers, consultants, and security teams who want to operate identity and endpoint environments at scale, securely, and with automation-first principles.
